- Recursive function: A function that calls itself to achieve a result

- Static typing: When the type of a variable is determined during the compile of a program

- Pattern matching: A way of allowing a function to operate differently under different input parameters. E.g. List pattern, wildcard pattern.

- List comprehension: A method of creating a list based upon other lists

- Higher order function: A function that takes another function as a parameter

- Curried function: A function that can take multiple parameters by applying the function to the first parameter and creates partially applied functions, each of which have a single parameter

- Do: Syntax sugar over the Monad typeclass, that allows monadic code to be written in an imperative style.

- Typeclass: A set of behaviours, which can be implemented for one of a number of types

- Overflow: Occurs when a variable is assigned a value that it cannot hold

- Lifetime: Time period that something such as a variable or function can be accessed

- Expression: A set of entities that are connected by operators, representing a single value

- Declaration: when we specify properties of something. This includes properties such as type and return value.

- Pattern matching: A way of allowing a function to operate differently under different input parameters (examples List pattern, wildcard pattern)

- Polymorphism: the property of having multiple types

- Polymorphic type: A type that can represent multiple different types

- Guarded function: A function that makes use of guards allowing the function to operate

- under different conditions

- Function composition: This is the use of a function return value as the argument of another

- Tuple type: This is the type of a turple which consists of two or more entities.

- QuickCheck: Provides a quick way of testing a Haskell function by testing with lots of input automatically. OR a library in haskell used for automated random testing of function properties.

- Lazy Evaluation: Haskell will only evaluate when it needs to

- Non tail recursion: If the result of a recursive call must be processed, then it is non-tail Recursion

- Tail Recursion: If the result of a recursive call is not processed, then it is a tail recursion. The recursive call is at the end of the program. No other operation is done after the return of a recursive call.

- Basic Type: A type that is defined inside the Prelude package

- Algebraic data type: a type formed by combining other types using algebraic operations.

- Lambda abstraction: an anonymous function used to conveniently insert functions as parameters.

- pre-condition: certain conditions that should be satisfied before the execution of some code.
