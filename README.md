- **Exams held at the [ExCeL London](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3xvuyNSzDbHHyCty8 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExCeL_London") Centre**
- **Tip:** try writing your notes for yourself in 6 months (as if you have no pre-understanding)
    - *This helped me relearn what I had forgot*
- **Tip:** It helps to have really good notes before the exam *(maybe during the winter consolidate term 1 or a little bit after the weekend after you learnt a topic)*

# Principles of Programming

- https://github.com/sabdullahi18/PT23-24

## C

- Common pitfalls are:
    - pointers,
    - structures
    - Memory Allocation
- Worksheet questions are helpful for understanding the coursework
- Drawing Program

<img src="output.gif" alt="output.gif" width="435" height="546" class="jop-noMdConv">

- Many cool things you can do!

## Haskell

- I think the worksheet questions are a great way of understanding
- Common pitfalls are:
    - Basics of functional programming
    - list comprehension (relate to **Python** and **Math** definition)
    - higher-order functions

# Discrete Mathematics

- [Resources](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zcabiga_ucl_ac_uk/EoNXvdLRxZRJpv-zo8f1XnwBmAsukBd0GjXQfbGsoRu5Iw?e=QbUidh)
- The exam is quite easy
- Worksheets are helpful

# Design & Professional Skills

## Python (Term 1)

- Tetris coursework is fun and challenging

## Ethics (Term 2)

- Read the Writing Guidelines thoroughly
    - Marked harshly on paragraph length, first sentence topic, flow of paragraph ect

# Engineering Challenges

- **Teamwork**: It really helps to meet up with your team in-person, and discuss your plans, next steps, problems, delegate tasks ect. (and its fun!)
    
- ### Arduino IDE setup
    
    - [**Arduino Installation for the PC URL**](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=5762303)
        
        - Installation of software for ENGF0001 2023-24 for Windows. Note, I used windows 11 for this video, but the principles are the same for windows 10. Also note that there's been a new version of the ESP32 software since I made the video - just install the latest (i.e. the suggested) version.
            
            The URLs in the video are:
            
            Arduino: https://www.arduino.cc/
            
            ESP32 boards: https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html
            
            &nbsp;
            
    - [**Arduino Installation for the Mac URL**](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=5765109)
        
        ```

# Object-Oriented Programming

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Algorithms
[Notes](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/zcabiga_ucl_ac_uk/Documents/Year%201/Term%202/Algorithms/Notes?csf=1&web=1&e=X8aeGa)

- Expectation to learn content outside of lectures, and do problems in the lectures
- If possible, learn the content every week so that you understand what's going on in the lectures

# Theory of Computation
[Notes](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zcabiga_ucl_ac_uk/Ejl37Jn69j5BuW9BoYKgspcBi3y3E8CSdzntqpKC6pZmJA?e=bQPXwR)

## Logic

&nbsp;

## Automata

# Introductory Mathematics
[Notes](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zcabiga_ucl_ac_uk/EhSHwCWtUMFClDP8p-ALUZABuj_ASy3ivcuODlmC82OynA?e=XP0XEf)
- Each week is a new topic
- Can assume the exam is around the difficulty of the middle or middle-end of worksheet questions

&nbsp;

**Note:**¬†Please double-check important information (term dates, module weightings, exams ect.) Because I might have made a mistake!
